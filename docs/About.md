## üß™ Working with this Repo

This video provides an introduction to development for Electron.NET: [Electron.NET - Contributing Getting Started](https://youtu.be/Po-saU_Z6Ws)  
  
This repository consists of the main parts (API & CLI) and it's own "playground" ASP.NET Core application. Both main parts produce local NuGet packages, that are versioned with 99.0.0. The first thing you will need is to run one of the build scripts (.cmd or .ps1 for Windows, the .sh for macOS/Linux).

If you look for pure __[demo projects](https://github.com/ElectronNET)__ checkout the other repositories. 

The problem working with this repository is, that NuGet has a pretty aggressive cache, see [here for further information](https://github.com/ElectronNET/Electron.NET/wiki).
