Build cross platform desktop apps with .NET Core 2.0 and ASP.NET NET Core. 

Electron.NET is a __wrapper__ around a "normal" Electron application with an embedded ASP.NET Core application. Via our Electron.NET IPC bridge we can invoke Electron APIs from .NET.

The CLI extensions hosts our toolset to build and start Electron.NET applications.

## Wait - you host a .NET Core app inside Electron? Why?

Well... there are lots of different approaches how to get a X-plat desktop app running. We thought it would be nice for .NET devs to use the ASP.NET Core environment and just embed it inside a pretty robust X-plat enviroment called Electron. Porting Electron to .NET is not a goal of this project, at least we don't have any clue how to do it. We just combine ASP.NET Core & Electron. 

# NuGet:

* API [![NuGet](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/ElectronNET.API.svg?style=flat-square)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/ElectronNET.API/) 
* CLI [![NuGet](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/ElectronNET.CLI.svg?style=flat-square)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/ElectronNET.CLI/)

# Requirements to run:

The current Electron.NET CLI builds Windows/macOS/Linux binaries. Our API uses .NET Core 2.0, so our minimum base OS is the same as [.NET Core 2](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/release-notes/2.0/2.0-supported-os.md).

# Usage:

To activate and communicate with the "native" (sort of native...) Electron API include the [ElectronNET.API NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/ElectronNET.API/) in your ASP.NET Core app.

````
PM> Install-Package ElectronNET.API
````
## Program.cs

You start Electron.NET up with an `UseElectron` WebHostBuilder-Extension. 

```csharp
public static IWebHost BuildWebHost(string[] args)
{
    return WebHost.CreateDefaultBuilder(args)
        .UseElectron(args)
        .UseStartup<Startup>()
        .Build();
}
```

## Startup.cs

Open the Electron Window in the Startup.cs file: 

```csharp
public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IHostingEnvironment env)
{
    if (env.IsDevelopment())
    {
        app.UseDeveloperExceptionPage();
        app.UseBrowserLink();
    }
    else
    {
        app.UseExceptionHandler("/Home/Error");
    }

    app.UseStaticFiles();

    app.UseMvc(routes =>
    {
        routes.MapRoute(
            name: "default",
            template: "{controller=Home}/{action=Index}/{id?}");
    });

    // Open the Electron-Window here
    Task.Run(async () => await Electron.WindowManager.CreateWindowAsync());
}
```

__Please note:__ Currently it is important to use ASP.NET Core with MVC. If you are working with the dotnet CLI, use

    dotnet new mvc

## Start the Application

To start the application make sure you have installed the "[ElectronNET.CLI](https://www.nuget.org/packages/ElectronNET.CLI/)" packages as global tool:

    dotnet tool install ElectronNET.CLI -g

* Make sure you have __node.js v8.6.0__ and on __macOS/Linux__ the electron-packager installed! 
    
    sudo npm install electron-packager --global

At the first time, you need an Electron.NET project initialization. Type the following command in your ASP.NET Core folder:

```
    electronize init
```

* Now a electronnet.manifest.json should appear in your ASP.NET Core project
* Now run the following:

```
    electronize start
```
### Note
> Only the first electronize start is slow. The next will go on faster.

## Debug

Start your Electron.NET application with the Electron.NET CLI command. In Visual Studio attach to your running application instance. Go in the __Debug__ Menu and click on __Attach to Process...__. Sort by your projectname on the right and select it on the list.

## Usage of the Electron-API

A complete documentation will follow. Until then take a look in the source code of the sample application:  
[Electron.NET API Demos](https://github.com/ElectronNET/electron.net-api-demos)  

In this YouTube video, we show you how you can create a new project, use the Electron.NET API, debug a application and build an executable desktop app for Windows: [Electron.NET - Getting Started](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nuM6AojRFHk)  
  
## Build

Here you need the Electron.NET CLI as well. Type the following command in your ASP.NET Core folder:

```
    electronize build /target win
```

There are additional platforms available:

```
    electronize build /target win
    electronize build /target osx
    electronize build /target linux
```

Those three "default" targets will produce x64 packages for those platforms.

For certain NuGet packages or certain scenarios you may want to build a pure x86 application. To support those things you can define the desired [.NET Core runtime](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/rid-catalog), the [electron platform](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-packager/blob/master/docs/api.md#platform) and [electron architecture](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-packager/blob/master/docs/api.md#arch) like this:

```
    electronize build build /target custom win7-x86;win32 /electron-arch ia32 
```

The end result should be an electron app under your __/bin/desktop__ folder.

## Starter kits

There is a React/Typescript/MobX starter kit at https://github.com/yoDon/Electron.NET-React-Typescript-MobX

### Note
> macOS builds can't be created on Windows machines because they require symlinks that aren't supported on Windows (per [this Electron issue](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-packager/issues/71)). macOS builds can be produced on either Linux or macOS machines.

# Working with this Repo

This repository consists of the main parts (API & CLI) and it's own "playground" ASP.NET Core application. Both main parts produce local NuGet packages, that are versioned with 1.0.0. The first thing you will need is to run one of the buildAll scripts (.cmd for Windows, the other for macOS/Linux).

If you look for pure __[demo projects](https://github.com/ElectronNET)__ checkout the other repositories. 

The problem working with this repository is, that NuGet has a pretty aggressive cache, see [here for further information](https://github.com/ElectronNET/Electron.NET/wiki).

# Important notes

## ElectronNET.CLI Version 0.0.9

In the Version 0.0.9 the CLI was not a global tool and needed to be registred like this in the .csproj:

```
    <ItemGroup>
         <DotNetCliToolReference Include="ElectronNET.CLI" Version="0.0.9" />
    </ItemGroup>
```

After you edited the .csproj-file, you need to restore your NuGet packages within your Project. Run the follwoing command in your ASP.NET Core folder:

```
    dotnet restore
```


If you still use this version you will need to invoke it like this:

    dotnet electronize ...
